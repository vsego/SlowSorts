SlowSorts
===

Many years ago, I noticed how popular it is to try to make things _faster_, a typical example of those efforts being sorts. I found this a bit one-sided, so I developed slow sorts, stellar examples of how to rely on already available solutions, even if they are not really that good or even appropriate.

Lo and behold, here are these masterpieces of anti-optimization:

* [Hard sort](hard_sort.md),

* [Interactive sort](interactive_sort.md) with [Python example](interactive_sort.py).

Feel free to use these in your company's project, but please use the proper attribution, so I can get angry e-mails from your project lead and colleagues.
